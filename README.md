Hi! I'm Marcel. I have recently completed a 4 month bootcamp at BrainStation, where I learned software fundamentals and created multiple fullstack projects. I believe my proven ability to learn quickly in a fast paced environment is what makes me well suited to be an efficient and effective Software Engineer. 

I am currently seeking Winter 2025 co-ops, please contact me at m6lui@uwaterloo.ca

Please check out my porfolio, it is live at https://marcellui.netlify.app
