Hi! I'm Marcel. I'm a bit new to Software engineering, but I have recently completed a 4 month bootcamp at BrainStation, where I covered fullstack fundamentals and created multiple fullstack projects. I believe my proven ability to learn quickly in a fast paced environment is what makes me well suited to be an efficient and effective Software Engineer. 

I am currently seeking 2024 summer co-ops, so if you are interested in me joining your team, please contact me at m6lui@uwaterloo.ca
